## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

- The three roughness indices were calculated using the [rogi](https://github.com/coleygroup/rogi) software package developed by **Coley et al. (2022)** in their work *Roughness of Molecular Property Landscapes and Its Impact on Modellability*.
- To compare different feature sets, for **SARI** we configured a **dynamic similarity threshold** equivalent to `MACCSkeys_similarity > 0.6`.
