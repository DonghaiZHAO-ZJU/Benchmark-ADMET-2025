## 🧪 **Datasets Assembling and Preprocessing**

In order to evaluate the potential of various drug efficacy prediction models in practical applications, in this project, we integrated multiple publicly available datasets covering key ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) prediction endpoints.

Our data processing pipeline involves two key stages: **(1) Data Curation** and **(2) Strategic Data Splitting**.

### 1. Datasets Used

We selected a diverse set of datasets to ensure our benchmark is comprehensive. Each dataset was meticulously cleaned, standardized, and deduplicated using the scripts located in the `data/` directory.

The primary datasets used in this study are summarized below:

### 2. Data Splitting Strategies

A critical aspect of evaluating model generalization is the data splitting strategy. To rigorously test the models and simulate real-world scenarios where models must predict on novel chemical matter, we employed several splitting methods beyond a simple random split.

Our splitting strategies include:

* **Random Split**: The standard, baseline approach where data is partitioned randomly. This tests a model's general interpolation ability.

* **Scaffold Split**: This method separates molecules based on their core chemical structure (scaffold). All molecules sharing the same scaffold are placed in the same set (either train or test). This is crucial for testing a model's ability to **generalize to new chemical scaffolds**, which is a more realistic and challenging task.

* **Perimeter Split**: To further stress-test the models, we used advanced splitters from the `mood` library. These methods create splits where the test set is intentionally dissimilar from the training set, testing the model's extrapolation capabilities. The specific methods used include:

The implementation for these splitting methods can be found in the `data/datasplitting.py` file. This multi-faceted approach ensures a thorough and robust comparison of the different ADMET predictors.
